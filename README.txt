LIBRARY DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
========================


This is a prototype model built as a personal project. The executable JAR file can be found after unzipping the folder:

> dist > project.jar

Requirements:

This project uses database run on MySQL.
The opening screen allows the user to enter path along with username and password to enable the program to connect to MySQL. This screen is only for the prototype model since the above variables cannot be hard coded in the program.

Instructions:

To begin using the prototype, one can login as admin using the following detail:

Username: admin
Password: admin

The admin can then add, edit, delete books and users. The information is saved in a database. The user can browse and search books and submit borrowing requests for upto 2 books at a time. The admin can then accept the request to lend the book or reject the request. Once a book is borrowed by a user, it will show up on their login home screen along with the issued timestamp.
